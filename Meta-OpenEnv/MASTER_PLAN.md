## 1. DOMAIN SELECTION

### Candidate Domains

#### A) IT Helpdesk Ticket Triage & Resolution
- **What**: Agent reads incoming IT support tickets, classifies priority, assigns to correct team, and suggests resolution actions.
- Real-world utility: **9/10** — Every company with >50 employees has this workflow.
- Creativity/novelty: **7/10** — Related to "customer support" but narrower and more technical.
- Ease of deterministic grading: **10/10** — Each ticket has a known correct priority, team, and resolution. Binary per-field, aggregated for partial credit.
- Reward shaping quality: **9/10** — Every action (classify, assign, resolve) gives incremental signal.
- Difficulty scaling: **9/10** — Easy: 5 obvious tickets. Medium: 15 tickets with ambiguity. Hard: 30+ tickets with cascading dependencies, SLA pressure, red herrings.
- Feasibility: **10/10** — Pure text, zero external dependencies, tiny memory footprint.
- Reliability: **9/10** — Deterministic seed-based generation, no randomness at grading time.

#### B) Data Cleaning Pipeline
- **What**: Agent receives messy tabular data and must identify and fix errors (missing values, type mismatches, duplicates, outliers).
- Real-world utility: **9/10** — Universal data task.
- Creativity/novelty: **6/10** — Common hackathon topic.
- Ease of deterministic grading: **8/10** — Can compare cleaned output to ground truth, but edge cases in "acceptable" fixes.
- Reward shaping quality: **7/10** — Per-row or per-cell fix rewards, but some fixes are all-or-nothing.
- Difficulty scaling: **7/10** — Hard to make "hard" task genuinely hard for frontier LLMs since patterns repeat.
- Feasibility: **9/10** — Lightweight, but need to generate realistic dirty data.
- Reliability: **7/10** — More edge cases in grading.

#### C) Cloud Infrastructure Alert Triage
- **What**: Agent monitors a stream of infrastructure alerts (CPU spikes, disk full, latency increase, OOM kills), identifies root causes, sets severity, and takes remediation actions.
- Real-world utility: **10/10** — SRE/DevOps teams do this 24/7.
- Creativity/novelty: **9/10** — Unlikely anyone else picks this. Very specific and technical.
- Ease of deterministic grading: **9/10** — Each alert has a known root cause and correct remediation.
- Reward shaping quality: **9/10** — Partial credit for correct severity even if wrong root cause; bonus for identifying cascading failures.
- Difficulty scaling: **9/10** — Easy: independent alerts. Medium: correlated alerts. Hard: cascading failures with noise alerts masking the real issue.
- Feasibility: **10/10** — Pure text, tiny footprint.
- Reliability: **9/10** — Deterministic generation and grading.

### Comparison Table

| Criterion (weight)         | IT Helpdesk (A) | Data Cleaning (B) | Cloud Alerts (C) |
|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Real-world utility (30%)  | 9               | 9                 | 10                |
| Task/grader quality (25%) | 10              | 8                 | 9                 |
| Environment design (20%)  | 9               | 7                 | 9                 |
| Code quality (15%)        | 10              | 9                 | 9                 |
| Creativity (10%)          | 7               | 6                 | 9                 |
| **Weighted total**        | **9.15**        | **7.95**          | **9.40**          |

### FINAL CHOICE: C — Cloud Infrastructure Alert Triage

**Justification**: Highest weighted score. Strongest on creativity (judges reward novelty). Extremely real-world — fills a genuine gap since no OpenEnv environment likely models SRE workflows. Grading is clean and deterministic. Difficulty scaling is natural: isolated alerts → correlated alerts → cascading failures with noise. Pure text, zero heavy dependencies, runs on 2 vCPU easily. The hard task is genuinely hard for LLMs because it requires multi-step causal reasoning across correlated events under noise.

## 2. FINAL ENVIRONMENT CONCEPT

### What It Simulates
An on-call SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) receives a batch of infrastructure monitoring alerts. The agent must triage each alert by:
1. Reading the alert details (service name, metric, severity hint, timestamp, message)
2. Classifying the **root cause category** (e.g., resource_exhaustion, network_failure, deployment_bug, config_error, dependency_outage, false_alarm)
3. Setting the **severity level** (critical, high, medium, low)
4. Choosing a **remediation action** (restart_service, scale_up, rollback_deploy, fix_config, escalate_to_team, acknowledge_and_monitor, dismiss)
5. Optionally **linking related alerts** (identifying that multiple alerts stem from the same incident)

### Who the Agent Is
The agent is an SRE on-call engineer at a mid-size tech company with ~20 microservices. They receive alerts from a monitoring system (like PagerDuty/Datadog).

### Entities in the World
- **Alerts**: Each has an ID, timestamp, source service, metric name, metric value, threshold, alert message, and optional context (recent deploy, dependency status).
- **Services**: A known set of microservices with dependency relationships (service A depends on service B).
- **Incidents**: Groups of related alerts that share a root cause (hidden from agent, used for grading).
- **Service Dependency Graph**: A simple DAG showing which services depend on which. Visible to the agent.

### Allowed Actions
Single action model with a `type` discriminator:

| Action type | Fields | Meaning |
|------------|--------|---------|
| `triage` | `alert_id`, `root_cause`, `severity`, `remediation` | Classify and act on one alert |
| `link_alerts` | `alert_ids`, `incident_label` | Group alerts as same incident |
| `skip` | `alert_id` | Explicitly skip an alert (acknowledge but take no action) |

### Observations Exposed to Agent
On `reset()` and after each `step()`:
- `alerts`: List of all alerts (full details). Already-triaged alerts are marked with the agent's previous decisions.
- `service_map`: The dependency graph (adjacency list).
- `pending_count`: Number of un-triaged alerts remaining.
- `step_number`: Current step.
- `max_steps`: Step budget for this episode.
- `feedback`: After each triage action, a short text hint (e.g., "Severity accepted" or "Consider checking upstream dependencies"). This gives learning signal without revealing ground truth.

### Hidden State (Not Shown to Agent)
- Ground truth root cause for each alert.
- Ground truth severity for each alert.
- Ground truth optimal remediation for each alert.
- Incident groupings (which alerts belong to the same incident).
- The seed used to generate the scenario.

### Episode Success
An episode ends when:
- All alerts have been triaged or skipped (natural completion), OR
- Step budget is exhausted.

Success is measured by the grader, which compares agent decisions to ground truth across all alerts.

### Incremental Reward Shaping
After every `triage` action:
- +0.3 if `root_cause` is correct
- +0.3 if `severity` is correct
- +0.2 if `remediation` is correct
- +0.1 if `severity` is within 1 level of correct (partial credit, not stacked with exact match)
- +0.1 bonus if alert is part of an incident AND agent has already correctly linked it

After `link_alerts`:
- +0.2 per correctly grouped pair of alerts
- -0.1 per incorrectly grouped pair

After `skip`:
- +0.2 if the alert is genuinely a `false_alarm`
- -0.3 if skipping a real critical/high alert

Penalties:
- -0.05 per step after 80% of step budget used (urgency pressure)
- -0.1 for invalid action format
- -0.2 for triaging an already-triaged alert
- No reward for no-op / doing nothing (budget drains)

### What Makes the Hard Task Hard
- 30+ alerts from 15+ services
- 4-5 distinct incidents where alerts cascade across dependent services
- 5-8 false alarm / noise alerts mixed in
- Ambiguous alerts where the metric alone doesn't distinguish root causes — agent must reason about the dependency graph and temporal correlation
- Some alerts have misleading severity hints (monitoring system says "critical" but it's actually a false alarm from a known flaky check)
- Tight step budget (can't brute-force by trying everything)

## Architecture Overview
Cloud Alert Triage OpenEnv environment. FastAPI server exposes /reset, /step, /state.

## File Purposes

| File | Purpose | Depends On |
|------|---------|-----------|
| server/app.py | FastAPI routes | models.py, environment.py |
| server/models.py | All Pydantic schemas | — |
| server/environment.py | Core env logic | models.py, scenario_generator.py, rewards.py |
| server/scenario_generator.py | Generates alerts from seed | models.py, service_graph.py |
| server/rewards.py | Computes per-step rewards | models.py |
| server/grading.py | Task graders (0-1 scores) | models.py |
| server/service_graph.py | Service dependency DAG | — |
| server/config.py | Constants and defaults | — |
| inference.py | Baseline LLM agent | OpenAI SDK, server API |
| openenv.yaml | OpenEnv metadata | — |
| Dockerfile | Container config | requirements.txt |

## Key Design Decisions
- Single Action model with `action_type` discriminator (not multiple models)
- Deterministic scenario generation via seed
- Rewards are per-step; grader score is end-of-episode
- One global environment instance (not per-session) for simplicity
- FastAPI with uvicorn

## Data Flow
reset(task_id, seed) → scenario_generator creates alerts → env stores state → returns observation
step(action) → env validates action → env updates state → rewards.py computes reward → returns (obs, reward, done, info)
state() → returns full internal state including hidden ground truth
```

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (30 min)
- **Objective**: Create repo skeleton, all empty files, docs scaffolding.
- **Why first**: Everything else depends on file structure existing.
- **Files created**: All directories, empty `__init__.py` files, `PROGRESS.md`, `MAP.md`, `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `Makefile`.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create directory tree exactly as specified in Section 3
  2. Write `PROGRESS.md` with template from above
  3. Write `MAP.md` with template from above
  4. Write `requirements.txt`: `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `pydantic>=2.0`, `openai`, `httpx` (for testing)
  5. Write `.env.example`: `API_BASE_URL=`, `MODEL_NAME=`, `HF_TOKEN=`, `OPENAI_API_KEY=`
  6. Write basic `Makefile` with targets: `run`, `test`, `docker-build`, `docker-run`, `validate`
- **Validation**: `ls -R` shows correct tree. `pip install -r requirements.txt` succeeds.
- **Failure modes**: Wrong directory nesting. Missing `__init__.py`.
- **Fix**: Re-check tree against Section 3.

### Phase 2: Data Models (45 min)
- **Objective**: Implement all Pydantic models in `server/models.py`.
- **Why now**: Every other module imports from models.
- **Files created/edited**: `server/models.py`
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define all models from Section 6
  2. Add validators and field constraints
  3. Write 2-3 inline examples as model_config examples
- **Validation**: `python -c "from server.models import *; print('OK')"`. Run `tests/test_models.py`.
- **Failure modes**: Pydantic v1 vs v2 syntax confusion. Missing Optional fields.
- **Fix**: Use Pydantic v2 syntax exclusively. Test instantiation with minimal and maximal data.

### Phase 3: Service Graph + Scenario Generator (60 min)
- **Objective**: Build deterministic alert/scenario generation.
- **Why now**: Environment core needs scenarios to exist.
- **Files created/edited**: `server/service_graph.py`, `server/scenario_generator.py`, `server/config.py`, `tasks/task_easy.json`, `tasks/task_medium.json`, `tasks/task_hard.json`
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define service dependency graph (15-20 services with clear hierarchy)
  2. Implement `generate_scenario(task_id, seed)` that returns alerts and ground truth
  3. Implement difficulty-specific generators: easy (5 alerts, 0 incidents), medium (15 alerts, 2 incidents), hard (30 alerts, 5 incidents + noise)
  4. Write task config JSON files with seed, params, expected alert counts
- **Validation**: `python -c "from server.scenario_generator import generate_scenario; s = generate_scenario('easy', 42); print(len(s.alerts))"` → 5. Same seed → same output (run twice, compare).
- **Failure modes**: Non-determinism from dict ordering or timestamps. Unrealistic alert messages.
- **Fix**: Use `random.Random(seed)` instance (not global). Sort all outputs. Use fixed relative timestamps.

### Phase 4: Environment Core (60 min)
- **Objective**: Implement `AlertTriageEnv` class with `reset()`, `step()`, `state()`.
- **Why now**: This is the heart of the project.
- **Files created/edited**: `server/environment.py`
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement `reset(task_id, seed)` → generates scenario, initializes state, returns observation
  2. Implement `step(action)` → validates action, updates state, computes reward, checks done
  3. Implement `state()` → returns full state including ground truth
  4. Handle edge cases: double-triage, invalid alert_id, episode already done
- **Validation**: Manual walkthrough: reset → step (valid triage) → check state updated → step until done. `tests/test_environment.py`.
- **Failure modes**: State mutation bugs. Forgetting to copy state. Off-by-one in step counting.
- **Fix**: Use immutable patterns or explicit deep copies. Add assertion checks in step().

### Phase 5: Reward System (30 min)
- **Objective**: Implement reward calculation.
- **Why now**: Depends on models + environment state.
- **Files created/edited**: `server/rewards.py`
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement `compute_reward(action, ground_truth, env_state)` returning float
  2. Handle all action types (triage, link_alerts, skip)
  3. Add step-budget pressure penalty
  4. Add invalid action penalty
- **Validation**: Unit tests with known inputs → known rewards. Check reward examples from Section 8.
- **Failure modes**: Reward values not summing correctly. Penalties applied wrong.
- **Fix**: Test each reward component independently.

### Phase 6: Graders (30 min)
- **Objective**: Implement per-task grader functions.
- **Why now**: Depends on environment state at episode end.
- **Files created/edited**: `server/grading.py`
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement `grade_episode(task_id, final_state)` → float in [0.0, 1.0]
  2. Implement per-field accuracy scoring
  3. Implement incident-linking bonus
  4. Clamp output to [0.0, 1.0]
- **Validation**: Run known-good trajectory → expected score. Run known-bad trajectory → low score. Same input twice → same output (determinism).
- **Failure modes**: Division by zero if no alerts. Score outside [0, 1].
- **Fix**: Guard all divisions. Clamp final output.

### Phase 7: API Server (45 min)
- **Objective**: FastAPI app exposing /reset, /step, /state endpoints.
- **Why now**: Depends on everything above.
- **Files created/edited**: `server/app.py`
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create FastAPI app
  2. POST `/reset` — accepts `{task_id, seed}`, calls `env.reset()`, returns observation
  3. POST `/step` — accepts action JSON, calls `env.step()`, returns `{observation, reward, done, info}`
  4. GET `/state` — returns current state
  5. GET `/health` — returns 200
  6. Add error handling (422 for bad input, 400 for invalid state transitions)
- **Validation**: `uvicorn server.app:app` then `curl -X POST localhost:8000/reset -d '{"task_id":"easy","seed":42}'` → 200 with observation JSON.
- **Failure modes**: CORS issues. Wrong content types. Pydantic serialization errors with nested models.
- **Fix**: Add CORS middleware. Use `.model_dump()` for responses. Test with curl.

### Phase 8: openenv.yaml (15 min)
- **Objective**: Write metadata file.
- **Why now**: Can be written once API shape is finalized.
- **Files created/edited**: `openenv.yaml`
- **Tasks**: Write all fields per Section 11.
- **Validation**: `openenv validate` passes (install openenv-core first).
- **Failure modes**: Wrong field names. Missing required fields. VERIFY MANUALLY against latest openenv-core docs.

### Phase 9: inference.py (60 min)
- **Objective**: Baseline agent using OpenAI SDK.
- **Why now**: Needs working API server.
- **Files created/edited**: `inference.py`
- **Tasks**:
  1. Read env vars (API_BASE_URL, MODEL_NAME, HF_TOKEN/API_KEY)
  2. Connect to environment via HTTP
  3. Run all 3 tasks sequentially
  4. For each task: reset → loop (observe → prompt LLM → parse action → step) → log
  5. Print exact [START], [STEP], [END] logs
  6. Handle LLM errors gracefully (retry once, then default action)
  7. Enforce 20-minute total timeout
- **Validation**: Run against local server with a real or mock LLM. Check log format matches spec exactly.
- **Failure modes**: LLM returns unparseable action. Timeout. Auth errors.
- **Fix**: Wrap LLM calls in try/except. Parse action with fallback to "skip". Add per-task timeout.

### Phase 10: Tests (30 min)
- **Objective**: Core tests pass.
- **Files created/edited**: All files in `tests/`
- **Tasks**: Write tests per Section 13.
- **Validation**: `pytest tests/ -v` all green.

### Phase 11: Docker (30 min)
- **Objective**: Working Dockerfile.
- **Files created/edited**: `Dockerfile`
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use `python:3.11-slim` base
  2. Copy requirements, install deps
  3. Copy source
  4. Expose port 7860 (HF Spaces default)
  5. CMD: `uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860`
- **Validation**: `docker build -t alert-triage .` succeeds. `docker run -p 7860:7860 alert-triage` then curl /reset → 200.
- **Failure modes**: Missing system deps. Wrong port. File permissions.
- **Fix**: Add `--no-cache-dir` to pip. Use port 7860. Check COPY paths.

### Phase 12: Local Validation (15 min)
- **Objective**: All pre-submission checks pass locally.
- **Tasks**: Run `scripts/validate.sh` or equivalent manual checks.
- **Validation**: HF Space ping (simulated), docker build, openenv validate all pass.

### Phase 13: HF Deployment (30 min, NEEDS HUMAN)
- **Objective**: Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Human creates HF Space (Docker type, tagged `openenv`)
  2. Push code to Space repo
  3. Wait for build
  4. Test /reset endpoint on live URL
- **Validation**: `curl -X POST https://<space-url>/reset` → 200.

### Phase 14: Final Polish (30 min)
- **Objective**: README, cleanup, final checks.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Write complete README per Section 5 spec
  2. Verify all baseline scores documented
  3. Run full inference.py against live Space
  4. Final code cleanup
- **Validation**: Full checklist from Section 17 all green.

## 6. DATA MODELS

All models use Pydantic v2 syntax (`from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator`).

### Alert
```
class Alert(BaseModel):
    alert_id: str              # e.g., "alert-001"
    timestamp: str             # ISO format relative timestamp, e.g., "2024-01-15T10:23:00Z"
    service: str               # e.g., "api-gateway"
    metric: str                # e.g., "cpu_usage_percent"
    metric_value: float        # e.g., 94.5
    threshold: float           # e.g., 80.0
    message: str               # human-readable alert text
    context: str | None = None # optional extra context (recent deploy, dependency info)
    triaged: bool = False      # whether agent has already triaged this
    agent_decision: dict | None = None  # agent's triage result if triaged
```

### Observation
```
class Observation(BaseModel):
    alerts: list[Alert]
    service_map: dict[str, list[str]]   # adjacency list
    pending_count: int
    step_number: int
    max_steps: int
    feedback: str = ""                  # hint after last action
```

### Action
Single model with discriminator:
```
class Action(BaseModel):
    action_type: str   # "triage" | "link_alerts" | "skip"

    # For triage:
    alert_id: str | None = None
    root_cause: str | None = None    # from ROOT_CAUSE_CATEGORIES
    severity: str | None = None      # "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low"
    remediation: str | None = None   # from REMEDIATION_ACTIONS

    # For link_alerts:
    alert_ids: list[str] | None = None
    incident_label: str | None = None

    # Validators ensure required fields present per action_type
```

**Why single model**: Simpler for LLM to output. Simpler JSON schema. Avoids discriminated union complexity in OpenEnv yaml. The validator approach catches missing fields per action_type at runtime.

### StepResult
```
class StepResult(BaseModel):
    observation: Observation
    reward: float
    done: bool
    info: dict = {}     # can include grader_score at episode end
```

### EnvironmentState
```
class EnvironmentState(BaseModel):
    task_id: str
    seed: int
    step_number: int
    max_steps: int
    done: bool
    alerts: list[Alert]
    ground_truth: list[dict]         # hidden truth per alert
    agent_decisions: list[dict]      # all decisions made
    incidents: list[dict]            # true incident groupings
    cumulative_reward: float
    grader_score: float | None = None  # populated when done
```

### ResetRequest
```
class ResetRequest(BaseModel):
    task_id: str = "easy"
    seed: int = 42
```

### TaskConfig
```
class TaskConfig(BaseModel):
    task_id: str
    title: str
    description: str
    difficulty: str
    default_seed: int
    num_alerts: int
    num_incidents: int
    noise_alerts: int
    max_steps: int
```

## 7. TASK DESIGN

### Task 1: "easy" — Basic Alert Classification
- **Task ID**: `easy`
- **Title**: Basic Alert Classification
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Scenario**: 5 independent alerts, each from a different service, with obvious root causes. No incidents (no correlated alerts). No noise.
- **Generation logic**: Pick 5 random services. For each, generate one alert with a clear and obvious root cause. E.g., high CPU on compute service → resource_exhaustion; failed health checks after deploy → deployment_bug.
- **Ambiguity**: None. Alert messages and metrics directly imply the root cause.
- **Max steps**: 10 (generous — only need 5 triage actions)
- **Ground truth**: Each alert has exactly one correct root_cause, severity, and remediation.
- **Grader**:
  - root_cause accuracy: correct / total alerts × 0.4
  - severity accuracy: correct / total × 0.3
  - remediation accuracy: correct / total × 0.3
  - Final = weighted sum, clamped to [0, 1]
- **Partial credit**: Each correct field on each alert contributes independently.
- **Failure cases**: Agent misclassifies obvious alerts, skips real alerts, tries to link non-incident alerts.
- **Expected score for strong LLM**: 0.85–1.0

### Task 2: "medium" — Correlated Incident Response
- **Task ID**: `medium`
- **Title**: Correlated Incident Response
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Scenario**: 15 alerts across 10 services. 2 distinct incidents (each incident = 3-4 correlated alerts cascading through dependency chain). 2-3 independent alerts. 1-2 noise/false alarms.
- **Generation logic**: Pick 2 root-cause services. For each, generate cascade: root service alert → dependent service alert → further dependent. Add independent alerts. Add false alarms (metric barely over threshold, known flaky check).
- **Ambiguity**: Moderate. Some cascaded alerts look like independent issues unless agent checks dependency graph. False alarms have borderline metrics.
- **Max steps**: 25
- **Ground truth**: Correct root_cause, severity, remediation per alert + correct incident groupings.
- **Grader**:
  - root_cause accuracy × 0.3
  - severity accuracy × 0.2
  - remediation accuracy × 0.2
  - incident linking F1 score × 0.2 (precision and recall of alert-pairs in same incident)
  - false alarm identification accuracy × 0.1
  - Final = weighted sum, clamped to [0, 1]
- **Partial credit**: Correctly triaging alerts within an incident gives partial even if linking is wrong. Getting severity within 1 level gives half credit.
- **Expected score for strong LLM**: 0.65–0.85

### Task 3: "hard" — Cascading Failure Under Noise
- **Task ID**: `hard`
- **Title**: Cascading Failure Under Noise
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Scenario**: 30 alerts across 15 services. 4-5 distinct incidents with deep cascades (3-5 hops). 5-8 noise alerts. Misleading severity hints (monitoring system marks a false alarm as "critical"). Temporal interleaving (alerts from different incidents arrive mixed). One "stealth" incident where the root cause service has a subtle alert (e.g., slow response time, not outright failure) but its dependents are screaming.
- **Generation logic**: Complex multi-incident generation with noise injection. Alerts shuffled by timestamp to break causal ordering.
- **Ambiguity**: High. Multiple alerts per service (some from different incidents). Root cause must be inferred from dependency graph + temporal correlation. Noise alerts distract.
- **Max steps**: 45 (tight — agent must be efficient)
- **Ground truth**: Full truth table.
- **Grader**: Same formula as medium but:
  - Incident linking is weighted more (0.25)
  - Stealth incident detection bonus: +0.05 if root cause of the stealth incident is correctly identified
  - Final = weighted sum, clamped to [0, 1]
- **What makes it genuinely hard**:
  - LLMs struggle with multi-hop causal reasoning across 15 services
  - Noise alerts consume steps and attention
  - Misleading severity requires ignoring the monitoring system's own classification
  - Temporal interleaving breaks the "just read alerts in order" heuristic
  - Tight step budget means brute-forcing costs too much
- **Expected score for strong LLM (GPT-4o)**: 0.40–0.65

## 8. REWARD DESIGN

### Per-Action Rewards

**For `triage` actions:**

| Component | Condition | Reward |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Root cause | Exact match | +0.30 |
| Root cause | Wrong | +0.00 |
| Severity | Exact match | +0.30 |
| Severity | Within 1 level | +0.10 |
| Severity | Wrong by 2+ | +0.00 |
| Remediation | Exact match | +0.20 |
| Remediation | Wrong | +0.00 |
| Incident link bonus | Alert is in an incident AND agent previously linked it correctly | +0.10 |

Max per triage action: +0.90 (0.80 base + 0.10 link bonus)

**For `link_alerts` actions:**

| Component | Condition | Reward |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Correct pair | Two alerts truly in same incident | +0.15 per pair |
| Incorrect pair | Two alerts NOT in same incident | -0.10 per pair |

**For `skip` actions:**

| Component | Condition | Reward |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| True false alarm | Alert's ground truth root_cause == "false_alarm" | +0.20 |
| Wrong skip | Skipping a real alert | -0.30 |

### Penalties

| Penalty | Condition | Amount |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Budget pressure | Step > 80% of max_steps | -0.05 per step |
| Invalid action | Malformed action or missing required fields | -0.10 |
| Double triage | Triaging an already-triaged alert | -0.15 |
| Already done | Stepping after episode is done | -0.00 (just return done=True) |

### How Total Reward Differs from Grader Score
- **Cumulative reward** = sum of all per-step rewards. Can exceed 1.0 or be negative.
- **Grader score** = accuracy-based, computed once at episode end, always in [0.0, 1.0].
- They correlate but are not identical. Reward guides the agent during the episode. Grader is the official evaluation metric.

### Example Trajectories

**Example 1: Perfect easy run (5 alerts)**
```
Step 1: triage alert-001, all correct → +0.80
Step 2: triage alert-002, all correct → +0.80
Step 3: triage alert-003, all correct → +0.80
Step 4: triage alert-004, all correct → +0.80
Step 5: triage alert-005, all correct → +0.80
Total reward: 4.00. Grader score: 1.00.
```

**Example 2: Partial medium run**
```
Step 1: triage alert-001, root_cause correct, severity wrong by 1, remediation correct → +0.30 + 0.10 + 0.20 = +0.60
Step 2: triage alert-002, all wrong → +0.00
Step 3: link_alerts [alert-003, alert-004] correctly → +0.15
Step 4: skip alert-010 (true false alarm) → +0.20
Step 5: triage alert-003, root_cause correct, severity correct, remediation wrong → +0.30 + 0.30 + 0.00 = +0.60
... (10 more steps)
Total reward: ~4.2. Grader score: ~0.55.
```

**Example 3: Bad run with penalties**
```
Step 1: invalid action (missing alert_id) → -0.10
Step 2: triage alert-001, all wrong → +0.00
Step 3: triage alert-001 again (double triage) → -0.15
Step 4: skip alert-002 (real critical alert) → -0.30
Step 5-10: (budget pressure kicks in at step 8/10) → -0.05 per step
Total reward: -0.85. Grader score: 0.05.
```

## 9. GRADER DESIGN

### Common Formula

```
score = (
    w_rc * root_cause_accuracy +
    w_sev * severity_accuracy +
    w_rem * remediation_accuracy +
    w_link * incident_link_f1 +
    w_fa * false_alarm_accuracy +
    bonus
)
score = clamp(score, 0.0, 1.0)
```

### Per-Task Weights

| Component | Easy | Medium | Hard |
|-----------|------|--------|------|
| root_cause_accuracy (w_rc) | 0.40 | 0.30 | 0.25 |
| severity_accuracy (w_sev) | 0.30 | 0.20 | 0.20 |
| remediation_accuracy (w_rem) | 0.30 | 0.20 | 0.15 |
| incident_link_f1 (w_link) | 0.00 | 0.20 | 0.25 |
| false_alarm_accuracy (w_fa) | 0.00 | 0.10 | 0.10 |
| stealth_bonus | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.05 |

### Accuracy Calculations

**root_cause_accuracy**: (number of alerts with correct root_cause) / (total alerts). Un-triaged alerts count as wrong.

**severity_accuracy**: For each alert, +1.0 if exact match, +0.5 if within 1 level, +0.0 otherwise. Sum / total alerts.

**remediation_accuracy**: (number correct) / (total alerts).

**incident_link_f1**: Convert agent's incident groups and true incident groups into sets of alert-pairs. Compute precision and recall of pairs. F1 = 2 * P * R / (P + R). If no true incidents, this component = 1.0 (vacuously correct). If true incidents exist but agent made no links, F1 = 0.0.

**false_alarm_accuracy**: (correctly skipped false alarms + correctly triaged real alerts) / (total false alarms + total real alerts among those the agent interacted with). If no false alarms exist, component = 1.0.

**stealth_bonus** (hard only): +0.05 if the root cause service of the "stealth incident" was correctly identified in at least one triage action for that incident.

### Determinism Guarantees
- All inputs are from `EnvironmentState` which is deterministic given seed.
- All calculations use exact arithmetic (no floats that depend on ordering). Use `round(score, 6)` as final step.
- No randomness in grading.

### Anti-Cheating Considerations
- Agent cannot access ground truth via /state during inference (inference.py only calls /reset and /step).
- Grader runs on final state, not on agent-reported data.
- Skipping all alerts gives 0.0 (un-triaged = wrong).
- Spamming the same answer for everything: root_cause accuracy will be ~1/6 (random chance among 6 categories).
- Trying to triage the same alert multiple times: second attempt gets penalty and is ignored for grading.

## 10. API DESIGN

### Endpoints

#### `POST /reset`
- **Request body**:
  ```json
  {
    "task_id": "easy",
    "seed": 42
  }
  ```
- **Response** (200):
  ```json
  {
    "observation": {
      "alerts": [
        {
          "alert_id": "alert-001",
          "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:23:00Z",
          "service": "api-gateway",
          "metric": "error_rate_percent",
          "metric_value": 15.2,
          "threshold": 5.0,
          "message": "Error rate spike on api-gateway: 15.2% (threshold: 5%)",
          "context": "Deploy v2.3.1 rolled out 10 minutes ago",
          "triaged": false,
          "agent_decision": null
        }
      ],
      "service_map": {
        "web-frontend": ["api-gateway"],
        "api-gateway": ["user-service", "order-service"],
        "user-service": ["postgres-primary"],
        "order-service": ["postgres-primary", "redis-cache"]
      },
      "pending_count": 5,
      "step_number": 0,
      "max_steps": 10,
      "feedback": ""
    }
  }
  ```
- **Errors**: 422 if invalid task_id.

#### `POST /step`
- **Request body**:
  ```json
  {
    "action_type": "triage",
    "alert_id": "alert-001",
    "root_cause": "deployment_bug",
    "severity": "high",
    "remediation": "rollback_deploy"
  }
  ```
- **Response** (200):
  ```json
  {
    "observation": { "..." },
    "reward": 0.80,
    "done": false,
    "info": {}
  }
  ```
- When `done` is true, `info` includes `{"grader_score": 0.85}`.
- **Errors**: 400 if no active episode. 422 if invalid action format.

#### `GET /state`
- **Response** (200): Full `EnvironmentState` JSON including ground truth.
- **Purpose**: Debugging and validation only.

#### `GET /health`
- **Response** (200): `{"status": "ok"}`

### Session Handling
- Single global environment instance.
- Calling `/reset` starts a new episode, discarding any in-progress episode.
- No authentication. No session tokens.
- This is appropriate for a hackathon. Production would need per-session instances.

---

## 11. OPENENV.YAML PLAN

**VERIFY MANUALLY**: The exact required fields may depend on the version of `openenv-core`. Install it and run `openenv validate` early. The following is the best-effort plan based on known OpenEnv conventions.

```yaml
name: cloud-alert-triage
version: "1.0.0"
description: >
  An SRE alert triage environment where an AI agent must classify,
  prioritize, and remediate cloud infrastructure monitoring alerts
  across a microservice dependency graph.
author: Better Call Coders
tags:
  - openenv
  - sre
  - devops
  - incident-response

tasks:
  - id: easy
    title: Basic Alert Classification
    description: Triage 5 independent alerts with clear root causes.
    difficulty: easy
  - id: medium
    title: Correlated Incident Response
    description: Triage 15 alerts including 2 correlated incidents and false alarms.
    difficulty: medium
  - id: hard
    title: Cascading Failure Under Noise
    description: Triage 30 alerts with 5 cascading incidents, noise, and misleading severity.
    difficulty: hard

action_space:
  type: object
  description: >
    JSON object with action_type (triage/link_alerts/skip) and
    corresponding fields. See README for full schema.

observation_space:
  type: object
  description: >
    JSON object containing alerts list, service dependency map,
    pending count, step number, max steps, and feedback string.

endpoints:
  reset: /reset
  step: /step
  state: /state
```

**Common validation mistakes to avoid**:
- Missing `tasks` list
- Wrong endpoint paths
- YAML syntax errors (watch indentation)
- Using `tab` characters (YAML requires spaces)

---

## 12. INFERENCE.PY PLAN

### Runtime Flow
```
1. Read env vars: API_BASE_URL, MODEL_NAME, OPENAI_API_KEY (or HF_TOKEN)
2. Create OpenAI client with base_url=API_BASE_URL, api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY
3. Set ENV_URL from env var or default to HF Space URL
4. For each task_id in ["easy", "medium", "hard"]:
   a. POST /reset with {task_id, seed: 42}
   b. Parse observation
   c. log_start(task_id, ...)
   d. Loop up to max_steps:
      i.   Format observation into compact prompt
      ii.  Call LLM with prompt → get text response
      iii. Parse text into Action JSON (with fallback)
      iv.  POST /step with action
      v.   Parse response (observation, reward, done, info)
      vi.  log_step(...)
      vii. If done: break
   e. Compute final score
   f. log_end(...)
5. Exit
```

### Prompt Strategy

System prompt (sent once per task):
```
You are an SRE triaging infrastructure alerts. For each alert, respond with a JSON action.
Valid action_types: triage, link_alerts, skip.
For triage: include alert_id, root_cause (one of: resource_exhaustion, network_failure, deployment_bug, config_error, dependency_outage, false_alarm), severity (critical/high/medium/low), remediation (restart_service/scale_up/rollback_deploy/fix_config/escalate_to_team/acknowledge_and_monitor/dismiss).
For link_alerts: include alert_ids (list) and incident_label (string).
For skip: include alert_id.
Respond ONLY with valid JSON. No explanation.
```

User prompt (per step):
```
Pending alerts: {pending_count}
Step {step_number}/{max_steps}
Last feedback: {feedback}

Untriaged alerts:
{compact alert summaries — only untriaged ones, max ~200 tokens each}

Service dependencies:
{compact adjacency list}

Respond with ONE action as JSON.
```

### Token Efficiency
- Only include untriaged alerts in prompt (not already-triaged ones)
- Truncate alert context if over 100 chars
- Omit service_map after first prompt if unchanged (or always include — it's small)
- Use the shortest possible field names in examples

### Action Parsing
```python
def parse_action(text: str) -> dict:
    # Strip markdown code fences if present
    text = text.strip().strip("```json").strip("```").strip()
    try:
        action = json.loads(text)
        if "action_type" in action:
            return action
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        pass
    # Fallback: skip the first untriaged alert
    return {"action_type": "skip", "alert_id": first_untriaged_id}
```

### Timeout Management
- Total budget: 20 minutes
- Per-task budget: 6 minutes (18 min for 3 tasks, 2 min buffer)
- Per-step LLM call timeout: 30 seconds
- If per-task budget exceeded, break and move to next task

### Exact Logging Schema

```
[START] {"task": "easy", "env": "cloud-alert-triage", "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
[STEP] {"step": 1, "action": {"action_type": "triage", "alert_id": "alert-001", ...}, "reward": 0.80, "done": false, "error": null}
[STEP] {"step": 2, "action": {"action_type": "triage", "alert_id": "alert-002", ...}, "reward": 0.60, "done": false, "error": null}
...
[END] {"success": true, "steps": 5, "score": 0.92, "rewards": [0.80, 0.60, 0.80, 0.80, 0.60]}
```

All log lines are valid JSON after the tag prefix. `score` is clamped to [0.0, 1.0].

### Reproducibility
- Use `seed=42` for all tasks in the default run.
- LLM temperature=0 (or as low as possible) for reproducibility.
- Document in README: "Baseline scores recorded with MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini, seed=42, temperature=0".

---

## 13. TESTING STRATEGY

### test_models.py
- **Purpose**: Validate Pydantic models accept valid data and reject invalid data.
- **Tests**:
  - Create Alert with all fields → succeeds
  - Create Alert with missing required field → ValidationError
  - Create Action with action_type="triage" but missing alert_id → ValidationError (if validator enforces)
  - Create Action with invalid root_cause → ValidationError
  - Serialize Observation to JSON and back → equal
- **Bugs caught**: Typos in field names, wrong types, missing validators.

### test_scenario_gen.py
- **Purpose**: Verify deterministic scenario generation.
- **Tests**:
  - generate_scenario("easy", 42) twice → identical output
  - generate_scenario("easy", 42) vs generate_scenario("easy", 99) → different output
  - Easy scenario has exactly 5 alerts
  - Medium scenario has 15 alerts
  - Hard scenario has 30 alerts
  - All alerts have valid services (exist in service graph)
  - All ground truth root_causes are valid enum values
- **Bugs caught**: Non-determinism, wrong alert counts, invalid data generation.

### test_environment.py
- **Purpose**: Core logic integration.
- **Tests**:
  - reset() → observation with correct pending_count
  - step(valid triage) → reward > 0, pending_count decreases
  - step(triage already-triaged alert) → penalty
  - step after done → done remains True
  - Full episode (all alerts triaged) → done == True and info contains grader_score
  - state() returns EnvironmentState with ground_truth populated
- **Bugs caught**: State mutation bugs, wrong done condition, missing grader call.

### test_rewards.py
- **Purpose**: Reward calculations are correct.
- **Tests**:
  - Perfect triage → 0.80 reward
  - Severity off by 1 → 0.10 instead of 0.30
  - Skip a false alarm → +0.20
  - Skip a real alert → -0.30
  - Step > 80% budget → penalty applied
  - Invalid action → -0.10
- **Bugs caught**: Wrong reward values, missing penalties, off-by-one in budget.

### test_graders.py
- **Purpose**: Grader determinism and correctness.
- **Tests**:
  - Perfect run → 1.0
  - All wrong → close to 0.0
  - Same input twice → same output
  - Partial run (some triaged, some not) → score between 0 and 1
  - Score is always in [0.0, 1.0]
- **Bugs caught**: Non-determinism, division by zero, score outside range.

### test_api.py
- **Purpose**: HTTP endpoint integration.
- **Setup**: Use FastAPI TestClient (httpx-based, no actual server needed).
- **Tests**:
  - POST /reset → 200, returns valid Observation JSON
  - POST /step with valid action → 200, returns StepResult JSON
  - POST /step without prior reset → 400
  - POST /step with invalid action → 422
  - GET /state → 200
  - GET /health → 200
- **Bugs caught**: Routing errors, serialization bugs, missing error handlers.

### Docker smoke test (manual)
```bash
docker build -t test-env .
docker run -d -p 7860:7860 --name test-env test-env
sleep 3
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X POST http://localhost:7860/reset \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task_id":"easy","seed":42}'
# Must print 200
docker stop test-env && docker rm test-env
```

---

## 14. DEBUGGING PLAYBOOK

### Bug: `/reset` returns 500
- **Symptom**: Server starts but /reset crashes.
- **Look at**: Server logs for traceback. Usually a Pydantic serialization error.
- **Common cause**: Model field has a type that's not JSON-serializable (e.g., `set` instead of `list`).
- **Fix**: Use `model_dump(mode="json")` or ensure all fields are JSON-compatible types.

### Bug: Non-deterministic scenario generation
- **Symptom**: Same seed produces different alerts.
- **Look at**: `scenario_generator.py`. Check if global `random` is used anywhere instead of the seeded `rng` instance.
- **Fix**: Pass `rng` instance to every helper function. Never use `random.random()` directly.

### Bug: Reward doesn't accumulate correctly
- **Symptom**: Total reward at end doesn't match sum of per-step rewards.
- **Look at**: `environment.py` — where is cumulative_reward updated?
- **Fix**: Ensure `self._cumulative_reward += reward` happens in `step()` after reward is computed.

### Bug: `openenv validate` fails
- **Symptom**: Validation script reports errors.
- **Look at**: `openenv.yaml` for typos, wrong indentation, missing fields.
- **Fix**: Install `openenv-core`, run `openenv validate`, read the error message carefully. **VERIFY MANUALLY** what fields the current version requires.

### Bug: Docker build fails
- **Symptom**: `docker build .` errors out.
- **Common causes**: Missing system dependency, wrong Python version, `requirements.txt` has broken package name.
- **Fix**: Check error log. Use `python:3.11-slim` base. Verify all package names with `pip install`.

### Bug: inference.py can't connect to environment
- **Symptom**: Connection refused or timeout.
- **Look at**: Is the server running? Is the port correct? Is `ENV_URL` env var set?
- **Fix**: Start server first. Use `http://localhost:7860` for local testing. Use HF Space URL for remote.

### Bug: LLM returns unparseable action
- **Symptom**: JSON decode error in inference.py.
- **Look at**: Raw LLM output. Often contains markdown fences or explanation text.
- **Fix**: Strip markdown fences. Use regex to extract JSON object. Fall back to skip action.

### Bug: Grader score outside [0, 1]
- **Symptom**: Score is negative or > 1.
- **Look at**: `grading.py`. Check that weights sum to ≤ 1.0. Check clamping logic.
- **Fix**: Add `score = max(0.0, min(1.0, score))` as final line.

### Bug: HF Space won't start
- **Symptom**: Space shows "Runtime error" or never finishes building.
- **Look at**: HF build logs.
- **Common causes**: Port not 7860, CMD wrong, dependency install fails.
- **Fix**: Match Dockerfile port to 7860. Test locally with Docker first.

## 15. HUMAN INPUT CHECKPOINTS

### Checkpoint 1: HF Token and Space Setup
- **What**: Create Hugging Face account, create a Docker-type Space, get HF_TOKEN.
- **When**: Before Phase 13 (HF Deployment). Can be done in parallel any time.
- **Format**: Provide `HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxx` and Space URL `https://huggingface.co/spaces/USERNAME/cloud-alert-triage`.
- **If not provided**: Agent can complete all phases 1-12 without this. Block only at Phase 13.

### Checkpoint 2: LLM API Key and Endpoint
- **What**: API key for whatever LLM service will be used (OpenAI, or whatever the hackathon provides).
- **When**: Before Phase 9 (inference.py testing). Can use mock/stub until then.
- **Format**: `API_BASE_URL=https://...` and `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` and `MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini`.
- **If not provided**: Agent can write inference.py but can't test it end-to-end. Can still test with a mock server.

### Checkpoint 3: Repository Push
- **What**: Human must push code to HF Space git repo (or set up CI).
- **When**: Phase 13.
- **Format**: `git remote add space https://huggingface.co/spaces/USERNAME/cloud-alert-triage` then `git push space main`.
- **If not provided**: Agent prepares all code locally. Human does the push.

### Checkpoint 4: Final Verification URL
- **What**: Human confirms the live Space URL and that it responds.
- **When**: After Phase 13.
- **Format**: "Space is live at https://USERNAME-cloud-alert-triage.hf.space"

### Checkpoint 5: Naming/Branding (Optional)
- **What**: Team name, project name, any custom branding for README.
- **When**: Phase 14 (Final Polish). Non-blocking.
- **Default if not provided**: Use "cloud-alert-triage" and "Better Call Coders".

## 16. TOKEN-EFFICIENCY AND MULTI-AGENT HANDOFF PROTOCOL

### Protocol Rules

1. **FIRST ACTION for any new agent**: Read `MAP.md` then `PROGRESS.md`. Do not read any source files until you know what exists and what phase the project is in.

2. **Before editing any file**: Read only that specific file. Do not read the whole repo.

3. **After completing any phase**:
   - Update `PROGRESS.md` with the standard change log entry (see template below)
   - Update `MAP.md` only if new files were created or architecture changed

4. **If unsure about a design decision**: Check `docs/decision_log.md` first. If not covered, make the simplest safe choice, document it in `decision_log.md`, and mark it in `PROGRESS.md` as an assumption.

5. **Do not rewrite files unnecessarily**. Use targeted edits (str_replace) instead of recreating entire files.

6. **Do not re-read files you just wrote**. Trust your own output within the same session.

7. **Request human input** by writing a clearly marked block in `PROGRESS.md`:
   ```
   ### HUMAN INPUT NEEDED
   - **What**: [specific request]
   - **Blocking**: [phase N] / [non-blocking]
   - **Default if not provided**: [fallback]
   ```

### Standard PROGRESS.md Update Template
```
### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] — [Agent/Human ID]
- **Phase**: [N — Phase Name]
- **Status**: COMPLETE / IN PROGRESS / BLOCKED
- **Files changed**: server/models.py, server/config.py
- **What was done**: Implemented all Pydantic models per Section 6 of master plan. Added field validators for enum types.
- **Tests passing**: test_models.py — 8/8 green
- **What's next**: Phase 3 — Scenario Generator
- **Blockers**: None
- **Assumptions**: Used Pydantic v2 syntax. Assumed openenv-core supports Pydantic v2.
```

### Recommended Agent Summary Format (for chat output)
```
✅ Phase N complete.
Files: [list]
Tests: [X/Y passing]
Next: Phase [N+1] — [Name]
Blockers: [None / description]
```

## 18. RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

| # | Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | `openenv validate` fails due to unknown schema requirements | HIGH | MEDIUM | Install openenv-core early. Run validate after Phase 8 immediately. Read source code of openenv-core if docs are lacking. Adapt yaml. |
| 2 | HF Space doesn't build or boot | HIGH | MEDIUM | Test Docker locally first (Phase 11). Use `python:3.11-slim`. Keep dependencies minimal. Check HF build logs. |
| 3 | inference.py exceeds 20-minute timeout | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Set per-task timeout of 6 min. Use fast model (gpt-4o-mini). Limit max_steps. Skip remaining tasks if time is low. |
| 4 | LLM returns unparseable actions frequently | MEDIUM | HIGH | Robust parsing with fallback. Strip markdown fences. Use structured prompts. Fall back to skip action. |
| 5 | Non-deterministic grading | HIGH | LOW | Use seeded RNG everywhere. Sort outputs. Test determinism explicitly. Round scores. |
| 6 | Reward hacking (agent finds shortcut) | LOW | LOW | Anti-cheating grader design. Penalize repeated actions. Grade on accuracy not reward total. |
| 7 | Judges can't reproduce baseline scores | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Document exact env vars, model, seed, temperature. Use deterministic seed=42. |
| 8 | Missing or wrong openenv.yaml fields | HIGH | MEDIUM | Verify manually. Run validate. Check openenv-core source if needed. |
| 9 | Deadline missed due to HF deployment issues | HIGH | LOW | Start HF Space creation early (parallel to coding). Have human on standby for Phase 13. |
| 10 | Environment too simple / boring for judges | MEDIUM | LOW | Hard task is genuinely hard. Incident cascading is interesting. README sells the value. |

### Minimum Viable Submission Path
If time is critically short, prioritize:
1. Phases 1-4 (bootstrap, models, scenario gen, env core) — functional /reset and /step
2. Phase 7 (API server) — endpoints work
3. Phase 8 (openenv.yaml) — validate passes
4. Phase 11 (Docker) — builds
5. Phase 13 (HF deploy) — live

Skip if needed: sophisticated rewards (use simple per-field accuracy as reward), complex hard task (use medium with more alerts), inference.py can use hardcoded actions as fallback.

### Best Possible Polished Submission Path
All 14 phases complete. Rich hard task with cascading incidents. Polished README with architecture diagram. All tests green. Baseline scores documented. Clean code with comments.

---

## 19. FINAL RECOMMENDED BUILD PROMPTS

### Prompt 1: Bootstrap

```
TASK: Create the repository skeleton for the cloud-alert-triage OpenEnv project.

Read the master plan's Section 3 (Repository Structure).

Create ALL directories and files listed. Files should be empty or minimal stubs except:
- PROGRESS.md: use the exact template from the master plan
- MAP.md: use the exact template from the master plan
- requirements.txt: fastapi>=0.100.0, uvicorn[standard]>=0.23.0, pydantic>=2.0.0, openai>=1.0.0, httpx>=0.24.0
- .env.example: API_BASE_URL=, MODEL_NAME=, OPENAI_API_KEY=, HF_TOKEN=, ENV_URL=http://localhost:7860
- Makefile: targets for run, test, docker-build, docker-run, validate, smoke, infer
- All __init__.py files: empty
- server/config.py: Define ROOT_CAUSE_CATEGORIES = ["resource_exhaustion", "network_failure", "deployment_bug", "config_error", "dependency_outage", "false_alarm"], SEVERITY_LEVELS = ["critical", "high", "medium", "low"], REMEDIATION_ACTIONS = ["restart_service", "scale_up", "rollback_deploy", "fix_config", "escalate_to_team", "acknowledge_and_monitor", "dismiss"], ACTION_TYPES = ["triage", "link_alerts", "skip"], MAX_STEPS_BY_TASK = {"easy": 10, "medium": 25, "hard": 45}, SEVERITY_ORDER = {"critical": 0, "high": 1, "medium": 2, "low": 3}

After creating all files, update PROGRESS.md to mark Phase 1 COMPLETE.
Verify: `ls -R` shows correct structure.
```

### Prompt 2: Core Models

```
TASK: Implement all Pydantic models in server/models.py.

Read MAP.md and PROGRESS.md first.
Read the master plan's Section 6 (Data Models).

Implement these models using Pydantic v2:
- Alert, Observation, Action (with validators per action_type), StepResult, EnvironmentState, ResetRequest, TaskConfig

Import enums/constants from server/config.py.

Action validators:
- If action_type == "triage": alert_id, root_cause, severity, remediation must all be non-None
- If action_type == "link_alerts": alert_ids must be non-None and len >= 2, incident_label must be non-None
- If action_type == "skip": alert_id must be non-None
- root_cause must be in ROOT_CAUSE_CATEGORIES if provided
- severity must be in SEVERITY_LEVELS if provided
- remediation must be in REMEDIATION_ACTIONS if provided

Write tests/test_models.py: test valid creation, test invalid data raises ValidationError, test JSON round-trip.

Update PROGRESS.md after completion.
```

### Prompt 3: Scenario Generator

```
TASK: Implement the service graph and deterministic scenario generator.

Read MAP.md and PROGRESS.md first.
Read the master plan's Sections 2, 7 for environment concept and task design.

server/service_graph.py:
- Define SERVICE_GRAPH dict with 15-20 microservices in a realistic dependency hierarchy:
  web-frontend → api-gateway → [user-service, order-service, search-service, notification-service]
  user-service → [postgres-primary, redis-cache]
  order-service → [postgres-primary, payment-gateway, inventory-service]
  ... etc. Make it realistic.
- Functions: get_service_names(), get_dependencies(service), get_dependents(service), get_graph_as_adjacency_list()

server/scenario_generator.py:
- generate_scenario(task_id, seed) → returns a dict with keys: alerts (list), ground_truth (list), incidents (list)
- Use random.Random(seed) for ALL randomness. Never use global random.
- Easy: 5 independent alerts, obvious root causes, no incidents
- Medium: 15 alerts, 2 incidents (3-4 alerts each cascading through deps), 2 independent, 1-2 false alarms
- Hard: 30 alerts, 4-5 incidents (some deep cascades), 5-8 noise/false alarms, one stealth incident, shuffled timestamps

Each alert must have realistic message text that hints at root cause.
Each ground_truth entry must have: alert_id, true_root_cause, true_severity, true_remediation, incident_id (or null).

Write tasks/task_easy.json, task_medium.json, task_hard.json with metadata.
Write tests/test_scenario_gen.py: determinism test, correct counts, valid fields.

Update PROGRESS.md after completion.
```

### Prompt 4: Environment Core + Rewards + Graders

```
TASK: Implement the core environment, reward system, and graders.

Read MAP.md and PROGRESS.md first.
Read the master plan's Sections 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

server/environment.py:
- class AlertTriageEnv with reset(task_id, seed), step(action), state()

- step: validate action, apply action to state, compute reward via rewards.py, check done condition, return StepResult. When done, include grader_score in info.
- state: return full EnvironmentState

server/rewards.py:
- compute_reward(action_dict, ground_truth_list, env_state_dict) → float
- Implement exact reward table from master plan Section 8
- Handle all action types and penalties

server/grading.py:
- grade_episode(task_id, final_state_dict) → float in [0.0, 1.0]
- Use per-task weights from master plan Section 9
- Implement accuracy calculations, incident F1, false alarm accuracy
- Always clamp to [0.0, 1.0]

Write tests for all three: test_environment.py, test_rewards.py, test_graders.py.

Update PROGRESS.md after completion.
```

### Prompt 5: API Server

```
TASK: Implement the FastAPI HTTP server.

Read MAP.md and PROGRESS.md first.

- POST /reset: accept ResetRequest body, call env.reset(), return {"observation": ...}
- POST /step: accept Action body, call env.step(), return StepResult as JSON
- GET /state: call env.state(), return EnvironmentState as JSON
- GET /health: return {"status": "ok"}
- Add CORSMiddleware(allow_origins=["*"], allow_methods=["*"], allow_headers=["*"])
- Add exception handlers for 400 (no active episode) and 422 (validation)

Write tests/test_api.py using FastAPI TestClient.

Test manually: start server with `uvicorn server.app:app --port 7860`, curl /reset, /step, /state.

Update PROGRESS.md after completion.
```

### Prompt 6: Inference Script

```
TASK: Implement inference.py baseline agent.

Read MAP.md and PROGRESS.md first.
Read the master plan's Section 12 (inference.py Plan).

inference.py in project root:
- Use `from openai import OpenAI`
- Read env vars: API_BASE_URL, MODEL_NAME, OPENAI_API_KEY (fall back to HF_TOKEN)
- Read ENV_URL env var (default http://localhost:7860)
- For each task in ["easy", "medium", "hard"]:
  - POST to {ENV_URL}/reset
  - Loop: format observation → call LLM → parse action → POST to {ENV_URL}/step
  - Print [START], [STEP], [END] logs in EXACT format from master plan
- Robust action parsing with fallback to skip
- Per-task timeout of 6 minutes
- LLM temperature=0
- Total timeout: 20 minutes

The [START], [STEP], [END] log format must be: tag followed by space followed by JSON on one line.
Example: [START] {"task": "easy", "env": "cloud-alert-triage", "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}

Update PROGRESS.md after completion.
```

### Prompt 7: Docker + OpenEnv YAML

```

- COPY . .
- EXPOSE 7860
- CMD ["uvicorn", "server.app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "7860"]

openenv.yaml:
- Use exact content from master plan Section 11
- Run `pip install openenv-core` and `openenv validate` to check

Test: docker build -t cloud-alert-triage . && docker run -p 7860:7860 cloud-alert-triage
Then curl -X POST http://localhost:7860/reset -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"task_id":"easy","seed":42}'
Must return 200.

Update PROGRESS.md after completion.
```

### Prompt 8: Validation + Bugfix

```
TASK: Run full validation suite and fix any issues.

Read MAP.md and PROGRESS.md first.

Run in order:
1. pytest tests/ -v → fix any failures
2. openenv validate → fix any yaml issues
3. docker build . → fix any build issues
4. docker run + curl /reset → fix any runtime issues
5. python inference.py (with local server running) → fix any inference issues
6. Check all [START]/[STEP]/[END] logs are correct format

For each failure: identify root cause, fix, re-run, confirm fix.

```

### Prompt 9: Final Polish

```
TASK: Write README.md and do final cleanup.

Read MAP.md and PROGRESS.md first.
Read the master plan's Section 5 (README spec).

README.md must include:
- Title: Cloud Alert Triage — OpenEnv Environment

- Architecture section with text diagram
- Action Space table (action_type, fields, types, meaning)
- Observation Space table (field, type, meaning)
- Task Descriptions table (ID, title, difficulty, description, expected score)
- Reward Design summary
- Setup: pip install, run locally, Docker, HF Space URL
- Baseline Scores table (task, model, score, steps)
- Team credit

Make README judge-friendly: scannable, uses tables, has clear structure, sells the project.

Final cleanup:
- Remove any debug prints
- Ensure all files have docstrings
- Update PROGRESS.md: mark all phases COMPLETE
- Verify master checklist all green

Update PROGRESS.md with final status.
```
